# Chapter 4 - Tooling for Test Automation

- Bare minimum for test automation project - [interaction tool] and [validation tool]
- Three test levels - [unit tests], [service], and [UI]

## Unit Test
- written in the same language
- execution is the call to the function

## Service Level
- for API's, execute the HTTP calls and read through the responses
- use a [language] that makes this easy, or [libraries] that boilerplates the work 

## UI
- [navigation library] provides ability to interact with HTML elements of application 
- look at how well the language is supported by automation tools
- consider [browsers] and [devices] you need to run automation against

## [Validation] Libraries
- turn your code into tests
- verify: functional, visual, accessibility, security, ...
- can also add a [Reporting Library] for screenshots, videos of failures, integration of "gherkin scenario files" if practicing [behavior-driven development]
- if running tests as part of CI, you'll want to choose tools that will allow for this integration
